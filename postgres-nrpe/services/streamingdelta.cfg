    _DETAILLEDESC        Check the replication from a primary. This check is specific to PostgreSQL replication configured *without repmgr*.
    _IMPACT              Urgent problem. Potential data loss or client application bugs (if app is sending select queries to secondary PostgreSQL).
    _FIXACTIONS          We never configure a PostgreSQL replication withou repmgr. So this replication is managed by the client. Talk to the client.
